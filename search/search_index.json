For more information, please refer to Introduction What I have done: seisflows/plugins/adjoint.py -Avoid dividing zero when mute near-offset data in envelope inversion. seisflows/tools/signal.py seisflows/preprocess/base.py -Apply tapered mask to shot gather, muting body waves and later waves to preserve surface wave only. seisflows/workflow/migration.py seisflows/solver/base.py -Fixed some bugs in RTM. The original code failed to get correct adjoint source. seisflows/solver/base.py -Allow to use different STATION file for different SOURCE. The naming rule must be same. The station name must be STATIONS_(shot_index). Add a new parameter 'PAR.USER_DEFINE_STATION' to control this feature. Remember to set use_existing_STATIONS=.true. when you use this option. You can ignore 'PAR.USER_DEFINE_STATION' if you use a fixed receiver array in synthetic test. This fixed receiver array can be define either by STATIONS file under specfem2d-master/DATA or parameters in Par_file. Add script to create mask model and plot misfit curves Add matlab scripts to convert SEGY data to SU format for SeisFlows. And Output geometry files Add scripts to generate simple specfem2d binary model Can use the latest SPECFEM2D instead of the specified version d745c542 After step 4 6, SeisFlows can be used for real data. Unsolved problems: Use GPU version SPECFEM2D in SeisFlows, try devel version Tikhonov regularization Need to do: Test double difference adjoint tomography Convert 3D seismic data to 2D. code Submit the job to cluster SeisFlows examples The examples link is not available now, you can find SeisFlows examples in my GitHub repositories: SeisFlows Examples Two layer model - Kernel tests Foothill model - Body/surface wave FWI tests Marmousi model - Body/surface wave FWI tests Will upload more examples in the future Project layout mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The documentation homepage. ... # Other markdown pages, images and other files.","title":"SeisFlows Development Log: New Functions to SeisFlows"},{"location":"#seisflows-development-log-new-functions-to-seisflows","text":"SeisFlows is an open source FWI package developed by Ryan Modrak.
